# _Episode 02 - Igniting Our App_

## Questions of Assignments
## Q: What is `npm`?
A: A `npm(Package manager)` is a package manager it's a place where developers can find, build and manage code packages.These packages can include libraries, frameworks, tools, and other dependencies that developers can use to build their applications.

## Q:What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

A: `Parcel` and `Webpack` are essential tools for modern JavaScript development, as they help manage dependencies, bundle assets, optimize code, and improve the overall development workflow. we need `Parcel/Webpack`as they allow developers to easily import and use external libraries and modules,reduce the number of HTTP requests and improves loading performance and tons of other things.

##  Q:Why is `.parcel-cache`?

A: The `.parcel-cache` directory is created by the Parcel bundler during the build process to store cached intermediate results and assets. This cache helps improve build performance by reusing previously processed files, reducing disk I/O operations, and optimizing dependency tracking. Developers do not need to interact directly with this directory as Parcel manages it automatically.


## Q:What is `npx`?

A: `npx` is a package runner that comes with npm (Node Package Manager). It allows you to run a package as a command-line tool without needing to install it globally. When you use `npx`, it automatically installs the package and runs it, then removes the package after running it. This is useful for running scripts or tools that you need only once or occasionally

## Q:What is difference between `dependencies vs devDependencies`?

A: `dependencies` are the packages that your application needs to run `examples:Express,React etcs`, while `devDependencies` are the packages that are only needed for development, such as testing or build tools ,`examples:Parcel,Vite,Jest`.

## Q:What is Tree Shaking?

A: The name `"tree shaking"` comes from the analogy of shaking a tree to remove dead leaves, where the "tree" represents the code dependency graph and the `"dead leaves"` represent unused code.

##  Q:What is Hot Module Replacement?

A: `Hot Module Replacement (HMR)` is a feature in module bundlers like Webpack and Parcel that allows developers to update modules in a running application without a full page reload. Instead of refreshing the entire page, HMR injects updated modules into the running application, preserving its current state and avoiding interruptions to the user experience.

## Q:List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.

A: The 5 `Superpowers of Parcel`are:-
 1. `Zero-config`means parcel will automatically install all of the necessary plugins and dev dependencies for you! 
 2. `Dev Server` means parcel includes a development server out of the box. Just run parcel index.html to get started.
 3. `Diagnostics` this one is my favorite as it shows you beautiful Error Messages and clearly states what and where is the error.
 4. `Image optimization` parcel supports resizing, converting, and optimizing images!
 5. `Code splitting` means when multiple parts of your application depend on the same common modules, they are automatically deduplicated into a separate bundle.
## Q:What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?

A: `gitignore` is a special file in a Git repository.It tells Git which files or folders to ignore and not track. 
    `What should we add to .gitignore?` :
        1. Files that are automatically generated during development.
        2. Files that don't need to be saved, like logs or temporary files like node_modules etc.
        3. Files specific to your computer or development environment.
    `What not to add to .gitignore?  `:
        1. Your actual code files that you want to keep track of.
        2. Configuration files that are important for the project to work.
        3. Anything with sensitive information, like passwords or secret keys.

## Q:What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files?

A: `package.json` is a JSON file containing information such as the project name, version, description, entry points, scripts, and dependencies.
`package-lock.json` is a file that is automatically generated by npm when dependencies are installed or updated.It basically keeps track of exact version of dependencies installed in a project.It ensures that everyone working on the project installs the same versions of dependencies.

##  Q:Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

A: Modifying `package-lock.json` can introduce inconsistencies, errors, version conflicts, and security vulnerabilities. It's best to let npm or yarn manage it automatically for consistency and reliability.

## Q:What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
A: 
`node_modules` is a directory created by npm or yarn to store all the dependencies of a Node.js project. It contains all the packages and modules installed via npm or yarn, including both the project's direct dependencies and their transitive dependencies.
Whether it is a good idea to push node_modules on git or not .The `answer` is `No`. The Reasons are 
    1. it is a large file,Pushing it can increase the size of the repository making harder to clone for other developers.
`Instead of committing node_modules to Git, it's recommended to:`

    1. Add node_modules to .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked by Git.
    2. Commit package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) to version control.
    3. Document installation instructions for developers to run npm install or yarn install to install dependencies locally. 
# Q:What is the `dist` folder?

A: The `the dist folder` serves as a convenient location to store the final output of the build process, making it easy to deploy or distribute the application to production environments.


## Q:What is `browserlists`?

A: `Browserslist` is a configuration tool that allows developers to specify which browsers their projects should support.
